During the live project, I worked on an ASP.NET MVC user management system called ScehduleIT which was managaed under the SCRUM methodology and utilized TFS Version Control. 
With the access to the code in Visual Studio, I was able to map and get the solution to my computer and was also able to take a look at backlogs on the TFS website.
I worked on several changesets of the backlogs and had a stand-up meeting everyday at 11:00 am where the project leader and team members discussed what they have accomplished
yesteday and what they will be working on the day. We've also talked about any impediment so that the project leader could help out. I communicated with the team members through 
Slack when I commited migrations so that everyone would update the database to get the latest version.
